## Introduction
***Predictive Analytics*** is the use of current/historical data to make predictions about the future. This web application was built using React Javascript based on a a linear regression model trained on Los Angeles historical crime data. The Application predicts future crime counts. The crime count is calculated using the model parameters from the Linear Regression and the result is appended to a table on the page.
