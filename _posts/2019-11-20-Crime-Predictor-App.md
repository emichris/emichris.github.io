Using results of the linear regression, designed and built a web application for predicting crime count for Los Angeles. Used ReactJS form-onSubmit event handler and input-onChange event handler to get value of year from user. The crime count is calculated using the model parameters from the Linear Regression and the result is appended to a table on the page. The screenshot of the web app is shown below; each section represents a page on the app.
