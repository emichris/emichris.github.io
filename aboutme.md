From 2013, he’s worked as a research intern programming microcontrollers in smart LED light fixtures for a novel way for tracking occupants and assets using visible light communication (he currently holds a joint patent on this idea). In 2017, he worked as a software engineering intern writing Python programs to diagnose cancer from skin lesion images. His program achieved more than 75% accuracy (a 12% improvement over the previous year performance). In 2018, he worked with the Baltimore City Public Schools’ Human Capital Office as a Data Analyst providing business intelligence and insight on staff performance and retention by analyzing 15 years’ worth of data stored in Oracle.
